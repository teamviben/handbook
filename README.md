-   **Strong work ethics**: Work matters. It puts food on the table as well as bring meaning to our life. If you are working with us, bring your A game. If you are considering freelance or work part-time with other firms along with a full-time job with us, please talk to your manager beforehand. In our experience, this almost never works. If you want to broaden your horizon, talk to your manager. We often encourage giving back to the community and can help you identify right open source projects to contribute.
-   **Do not give up**: From time to time, you will find yourself in a situation that may be out of your comfort zone. Do not give up. Ever. Push yourself and you will win.
-   **Team player**: Appreciate if someone did well. Help them improve by giving them constructive feedback when you see an opportunity for your team members to grow.


### Best Practices

-   Be on time. Respect other people time.
-   Be patient. Listen first. Understand other's perspective first. Speak after.
-   Always be professional in both verbal and written communication, both internally and externally. Use Grammarly if you need help with your written communication.
-   If you are on a call, please turn on video in both internal and external communication. It feels pretty weird talking to a computer. Seeing creates a human connection.
-   Make sure your profile accurately describes what you do on Github, LinkedIn, Angel.co including a profile picture. Prospective clients and team members often research about us on the internet.

### Daily Status Update

-   Before you start your day at work, please update appropriate channel with Progress (What you worked upon), Plan (What you plan to work on), Problems (Any blocking issues). This is very important in remote work setting to let your customer and team know about your progress.
